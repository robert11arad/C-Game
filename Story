//Clearings
Start
You (NAME) just woke up in a dark place. You do not have any idea where you are. You must find your way out alive. On your journey, you may run into obstacles you have never imagined before. Choose a direction to proceed further.
1.	GO RIGHT/ GO EAST: 
1.1.	“There is a shed in the middle of nowhere. It seems like someone could be living there but it is dark and scary. What do you want to do?”

-	GO INTO THE SHED/ GO IN SHED: “You cannot go into the shed”
-	GO RIGHT FROM THE SHED/ GO EAST: “There is a dungeon. You may not get alive from there. Think wisely what to do.”
-	GO LEFT FROM THE SHED/ GO WEST: “There is a clearing leading to the high, cold mountains which are hiding unexpected secrets.” 


2.	GO LEFT/ GO WEST:
2.1.	“There is a massive tree nearby and nothing else in radius of 10 miles. If you chose to run to the right you will reach a swamp with ruins, and if you chose to fly left you will appear in the cloudland.”
-	FLY (TO) LEFT/ FLY (TO) WEST: “You are now in the cloudland….”
-	RUN (TO) RIGHT/ RUN (TO) EAST: “That exhausted you but you reached successfully the swamp…”


From cloud land: “There is nothing here. You have to proceed further so that you can finish the game.”
1.	PROCEED FURTHER/ PROCEED: “…”

“There is huge tree with a house on it. In the house are living fairies. They have a pond in which you have to swim if you want the fairies to let you pass.”

1.	CLIMB TREE: “You climbed the tree you need to enter the fairies house.”
-	ENTER HOUSE: “You are in the house but the fairies want to play a game with you before they let you pass. You can choose between paper, rock and scissors or roll a dice.” 
Fairies: “You are in our territory. We control the paths to this land. We will only let you pass if you play a game with us. We can play paper, rock and scissors or roll a dice.”



//Swamp(Thorns)
    	Swamp entrance

	As you enter the muddy swamp you notice that it is very large, it seems going around a mountain of some sorts and it 
stretches further to the North and to the West, more than you would’ve hoped it to. About 100 meters further from the entrance 
there is a Temple in ruins, it seems very old, like no one has entered it for thousands of years, you’re not sure if you should 
go in there, maybe you’re disturbing a sacred place. About  50 meters to the right of the Temple there is a bush of thorny, green 
vines that have grown on them some beautiful pink flowers, they’re like nothing you’ve ever seen before, you feel like you have 
to hold at least one in your hands.

    	Ruined Temple

	As you make the first step inside the temple you feel a chill go down your spine, you can hear pebbles falling down from 
the giant roof made of stone, you smell the old dust that’s been gathering there for a very long time. The walls have a lot of 
cracks in them and the light passes through barely so you can see where you’re stepping, the only thing you know so far is that 
you’re in a great hall that seems made for giants, and the only thing you can see clearly is the light coming from the door you 
left behind you slowly fading away. You got to a giant opening where in the middle is a giant statue and a lot of fallen pillars, 
you’re wondering how is it that the whole thing didn’t collapse already with so few pillars sustaining the giant roof. As you 
look around the statue you observe some kind of lines and circles on the ground, the lines are connecting the circles to the 
statue, and inside the circles are some kind of golden plates.

-Investigate Statue. <Ruined Temple/ Statue>
-Check the strange drawings on the floor that connect the statue with the golden plates. <Ruined Temple/ Drawings>
-Investigate the golden plates, hopefully they are indeed made of gold and you can get some money. <Ruined Temple/ Golden Plates>
-Keep roaming around, maybe there’s something you’re not seeing, or maybe there isn’t, but you can’t be sure, can you? 
<Ruined Temple/ "Around">
-Leave temple. <Swamp entrance- After Temple>


	Ruined Temple – Statue

	As you approach the statue you start to feel a warmth, like the sun is shining upon your skin, which seems a little 
strange since you’re wearing clothes and it feels like the sun is warming you everywhere, and I mean everywhere, apart from the 
fact that you are in a dark room, inside a temple, made of stone and there is no sunlight… Even though you feel like you’re going 
crazy you make it to the statue and put your hand on it’s pedestal, as your hand touches the pedestal you feel bombarded with 
sunlight,  and the grass tickling your bare feet, you find yourself naked in that strange place, with your hand on the bark of a 
tree. You close your eyes and take your hand off of the tree, as you open them you notice that you are back in the temple, but 
now there is a giant ball of fire right above the statue’s head that lights the whole room. You take some steps back and look at 
the statue, which seems to be praising the sun, standing tall on two feet, with it’s both arms raised at a 45 degree angle of 
it’s head, with a giant ball of fire between it’s arms, right above it’s head.

	Ruined Temple – Solaire’s Statue

	This time when you approach the pedestal you don’t feel that warming light all over your body, just a little coming from 
the giant ball of fire above, but nevertheless, you put your hand on it and find yourself back to that field.

  	Ruined Temple - Drawings(Before Plate)
	
	You get down and put your face against the floor, looking how the line, that you have your face on, stretches like a road,
connecting the plate behind you to the statue that's right in front of you. Besides the strange pattern the drawings have,
there's nothing special to them, it looks like some yellow paint with a lot of layers of dust ontop.

	Ruined Temple - Drawings(After Plates)
	
	You get down next to one of the lines and extend your arm to touch it, you're lost in thought as you gaze your sight upon 
the golden line, the way it glows makes it seem like it's alive, like the fluctuations of it's glow is it's breathing, but 
you lose all this train of thoughts the moment you lay your hand on the line because it feels like you've just touched the sun, 
and no, i do not mean it as some profound and divine experience, i mean it as in you've just burned your fingers in such a manner 
that you can see the bones surounded by your black, burnt flesh. You quickly withdraw your hand and get up, you're bat shit 
scared you just lost three of your fingers and it hurts like hell, what the hell is wrong with whoever made this temple you 
wonder, why the obsesion with fire and gold? why couldn't they just put their valuables in a nice chest in a dark cave like a 
normal person? Why all these puzzles, what do the developers of the game think you are, a 4 years old with too much time in your 
hands?...(Player takes damage: 5%)

	Ruined Temple - Golden Plates(Empty)
	
	There are 3 golden plates around the statue, each of them inside their own yellow circle, one of them is behind the 
statue, slightly to the right, the other 2 are in front of the statue, the one closer to the statue between the two, is right in 
front of it about 5 cm to the left, and the other one is slightly further away from the statue and much more to the left. They 
seem to make some kind of pattern, the one behind being connected to the statue directly and the one right in front of it too, 
only the one that's further away is connected to the next golden plate instead of the statue directly. As you inspect the 
closest golden plate to you, you see something engraved right in the middle of it, something is written there: 𐌔𐌄𐌂𐌏𐌍𐌃𐌀 𐌔𐌕𐌄𐌋𐌋𐌀 
𐌃𐌄 𐌖𐌉𐌍𐌂𐌖𐌋𐌏. You go to check the other plates as well to see if there's anything written on them as well, and the moment you 
clean the dust away from the next plate you see there is something written on it too: 𐌐𐌓𐌉𐌌𐌀 𐌔𐌕𐌄𐌋𐌋𐌀 𐌃𐌄 𐌖𐌉𐌍𐌂𐌖𐌋𐌏, last you check 
the plate behind the statue, and on this one it's engarved: 𐌗𐌋𐌉𐌀𐌓𐌉. What could it mean you wonder, maybe it means something...

-Investigate Statue. <Ruined Temple/ Statue>
-Check the strange drawings on the floor that connect the statue with the golden plates. <Ruined Temple/ Drawings>
-Place collected materials on the plates. <Ruined Temple/ Active Plates> (Only if the player has all materials: a goat's horn, 
fur and nail)
-Keep roaming around, maybe there’s something you’re not seeing, or maybe there isn’t, but you can’t be sure, can you? 
<Ruined Temple/ "Around">
-Leave temple. <Swamp entrance- After Temple>


	Ruined Temple - Golden Plates(Activation/active)
	
	You place the materials on top of the strange characters written in the plates. You place the goat horn on the plate that 
has written "𐌗𐌋𐌉𐌀𐌓𐌉", the fur on the plate that has written "𐌔𐌄𐌂𐌏𐌍𐌃𐌀 𐌔𐌕𐌄𐌋𐌋𐌀 𐌃𐌄 𐌖𐌉𐌍𐌂𐌖𐌋𐌏" on it and the nail on the last plate: 
"𐌓𐌉𐌌𐌀 𐌔𐌕𐌄𐌋𐌋𐌀 𐌃𐌄 𐌖𐌉𐌍𐌂𐌖𐌋𐌏". As soon as the nail touches the golden plate, all 3 materials you just placed burst into flames, the 
strange drawings start to glow, first the circles surrounding the plates and then it slowly extends along the lines, it looks as 
if they would get filled with some liquid. As you follow the light along the lines, rising your eyes little by little, you notice 
that the light reveals something written on the pedestal of the statue, it says: "The Password is : ARIES". Now, now... don't get 
so full of yourself, just because you got the password doesn't mean you know what to do with it!

	Ruined Temple - "Around"
	
	"Who cares about strange statues or golden plates, there has to be somethiong better in this place" you thought to 
yourself as you wondered, step by step, into the darkness. Strangely, you barely went 5 steps into that soul-consuming darkness
and already hit a wall, with your face, hard! As you're falling on your ass you notice a strange light flashing around you, like 
a firefly with super-speed, like "Flashy Gonzales" carrying a torch, like a laser beam fired at you by a Hurricanetrooper, you 
get the idea. As you open your eyes and look in front of you, there's a giant door with 5 slots in it, one after another, 
arranged horizontaly, and all around you there are some stone cubes with letters engraved on them, they seem to fit perfectly 
into the sockets on the door. Ah! and there's light now, no idea where it is coming from but who cares, you can see. Maybe your 
head is a light bulb and your butt is the switch...

	Ruined Temple - Behind the door
	
	
	
	Swamp entrance - after temple
	
	You decidede to leave the teample and, honestly, i think it is a good idea, that place was really unsettling. You leave
the same way to came in, thorugh the front door, as you enter the long hallway that you entered through you start seeing the light
at the end, you move step by step towards it until you're finally outside, in the muddy swamp, at least you can breath some fresh 
air and feel the sun. It's way better to be outside exploring, than inside of that dusty old temple, what could even be in there?
some stupid caveman drawings on the walls?

	Ruined Temple - Another time
	
	Seriously? haven't you had enough of this dusty place? Fine, be it as you want. You get inside the temple once more, 
through the same, about to collapse, old hallway and voyla, you find yourself back in the middle of the large room, staring at 
the statue's odd stance.
